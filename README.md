This is a sample project using the Zephyr RTOS and Nordic nRF Connect to create a BLE watch. This device is composed with:

* nRF52840-DK Nordic board.
* OLED monochrome displays SSD1306 128x64 pixels.
* and the DS3231 real-time clock (RTC).

Both, display and RTC, communicates with the nRF52840 MCU via I2C bus.

Some topics covered:

* Tested on nRF52840-DK board.
* Embedded system with Zephyr RTOS and nRF Connect SDK.
* Bluetooth Low Energy 5.
